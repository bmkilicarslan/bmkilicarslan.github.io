I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Civil and Urban Engineering at New York University.

My research focuses on computational and statistical hydrosciences, with a special emphasis on flood inundation mapping, 
surrogate modeling, and hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling to adress different issues in Northeastern US. 

This includes conducting simulations for streamflow and flood inundation mapping, with a focus on developing 
decision support tools to assist stakeholders. As part of my Ph.D. work, I have succesfully integrated 
[a multi-satellite river ice product](https://web.stevens.edu/ismart/land_products/rivericemapping.html) into the modeling 
process by adjusting hydraulic properties. Additionally, I have worked on the implementation of machine learning-based surrogate 
or emulator models to improve computational efficiency and reduce the time required for hydrodynamic modeling, particularly for 
flood inundation mapping applications.

A key aspect of my posdoctoral work is understanding the patterns of upstream flooding triggered by 
infrastructure failures, which is crucial for enhancing flood risk assessments, strengthening disaster preparedness, 
and supporting informed decision-making at regional and national levels.
